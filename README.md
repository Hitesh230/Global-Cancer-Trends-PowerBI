## 📝 Project Overview
This project features a comprehensive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze global cancer trends over a **10-year period**. By visualizing data from **50,000 patients**, the dashboard provides a high-level view of cancer prevalence, genetic risk factors, and demographic correlations.

### 🎯 Key Objectives:
* **🌍 Trend Identification:** Track diagnosis shifts across different regions and years.
* **🧬 Genetic Correlation:** Analyze the link between genetic risk levels and cancer stages.
* **🚬 Lifestyle Impact:** Evaluate how factors like Alcohol and Smoking influence patient outcomes.
* **📈 Benchmarking:** Provide comparative performance metrics using 5-year rolling averages.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Stack & Skills
* **Core Tool:** Power BI Desktop / Power BI Service
* **Analytics Engine:** Advanced **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** for dynamic KPIs and trend comparisons.
* **Visualization:** Interactive Heatmaps, Slicers, and Longitudinal Trend Analysis.

---

## 💡 Featured Insights & DAX Implementation
The dashboard moves beyond simple counts to provide deeper medical and demographic context:

* **🔴 Dynamic KPI Indicators:** Implemented dynamic KPI cards for 8 cancer types (Liver, Cervical, Colon, etc.) that compare current patient counts against a **5-Year Average**.
* **🧬 Genetic Risk Heatmaps:** Used matrix visualizations to cross-analyze **Genetic Risk levels** against **Cancer Stages**, allowing for quick identification of high-risk clusters.
* **👥 Demographic Segmentation:** Analysis reveals that the **61+ demographic** accounts for the largest patient share (**20.71K**), with specialized tracking for Stage III and IV progression.
* **📈 Trend Analysis:** Integrated line charts to track patient counts and lifestyle averages (Smoking/Alcohol) over time to observe longitudinal shifts.

## 🕹️ How to Interact with this Project
1. **Direct Access:** Use the **[Live Link](https://app.powerbi.com/reportEmbed?reportId=daa1d151-940a-470b-821e-297955b45cde&autoAuth=true&ctid=ddfb84b8-2990-47d0-b18f-0a2fc6d042a3)** above for the fastest experience.
2. **Filter Dynamically:** Use the **Gender Slicer** and **Year Filter** to see how regional risks and patient counts shift in real-time.
3. **Local Exploration:** Alternatively, download the `.pbix` file from this repository and open it using Power BI Desktop to inspect the DAX formulas.
