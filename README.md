Global Cancer Trends Dashboard (2015-2024)
Project Overview
This project features a comprehensive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze global cancer trends over a 10-year period. By visualizing data from 50,000 patients, the dashboard provides a high-level view of cancer prevalence, genetic risk factors, and demographic correlations.

Key Objectives:
Identify trends in cancer diagnoses across different regions and years.

Analyze the correlation between genetic risk levels and cancer stages.

Evaluate the impact of lifestyle factors (Alcohol & Smoking) on patient outcomes.

Provide comparative performance metrics using 5-year averages.

Technical Stack
Tool: Power BI Desktop

Data Source: 50k Patient Records (Global Dataset)

Key Skills: Data Modeling, Power Query (ETL), DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), Data Visualization.

Featured Insights & DAX Implementation
The dashboard incorporates advanced analytics to provide deeper context than simple counts:

KPI Indicators: Implemented dynamic KPI cards for 8 cancer types (Liver, Cervical, Colon, etc.) that compare current patient counts against a 5-Year Average.

Genetic Risk Heatmaps: Used matrix visualizations to cross-analyze Genetic Risk levels against Cancer Stages and Geographic Regions, allowing for quick identification of high-risk clusters.

Demographic Segmentation: A stacked bar chart analyzes the patient distribution by Age Group (20-40, 41-60, 61 & Above) and Cancer Stage, revealing that the 61+ demographic accounts for the largest patient share (20.71K).

Trend Analysis: Integrated line charts to track patient counts and lifestyle averages (Smoking/Alcohol) over time to observe longitudinal shifts.
